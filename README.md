# Image Segmentation using Color Contours and Grayscale

This repository provides an implementation of image segmentation techniques using color contours and grayscale. It focuses on separating objects within an image based on their color and intensity patterns. The project includes methods for preprocessing, segmentation, and visualization of results.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Color-Based Segmentation**: Extract objects or regions based on color contours.
- **Grayscale Segmentation**: Perform segmentation using intensity levels for more nuanced object detection.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune segmentation thresholds and parameters.
- **Visualization Tools**: Visualize segmented outputs with clear boundaries.
- **Modular Codebase**: Easy to extend and integrate into other projects.
